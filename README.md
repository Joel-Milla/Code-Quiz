# Code-Quiz Mobile App

This project is a hands-on practice focused on creating a basic mobile app in SwiftUI, as part of a iOS mobile development course. The app consists of a quizz regarding computer science knowledge, while showing at the end of the quiz how many questions you got right with the option to retake the quiz. Additionally, this project is implementing the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture,following best practices in mobile app development.

## Key Features
- **Interactive UI**: Engage with multiple-choice questions, with four options each. Navigate through different views using intuitive buttons.
- **Responsive Application**: Immediate feedback on answers with color-coded responses - green for correct and red for incorrect. Each question allows only one attempt.
- **MVVM Architecture**: The app is structured using the MVVM architecture, dividing the project into different layers (Model, View, View-Model) for better manageability.
